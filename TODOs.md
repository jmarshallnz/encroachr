TODOs for JM for encroachr paper

Division and Risk bit
=====================

Figure 6:

1. Change power vs fragment plot to have say 3 lines on it (dilution = 1, more dilute, less dilute) (current Fig 4B)
2. Need a plot of risk (eRIDE) vs fragments for given powers (e.g. z=0.28)

Supp Figure 2 (or whatever)
- Plot of risk vs power for given fragment sizes, constant biodiversity (so diff areas)
- Plot of biod vs power for given fragment sizes, constant risk (so diff areas)

Maths:
Can we prove a single intercept with risk=1 (or biod=1) for a given number of fragments, and that z > 0.5, and whatever else (e.g. lim (z->inf), risk -> 1)

Change paragraph accordingly...

Then check effect of dilution on the above. How's it change stuff? e.g. no longer a solution/2 solutions??? So could maybe add a sentence here to results
about this, and then some maths in supp material.


Shape stuff
===========

Solidity vs Core ratio

Figure: Draw some debroglie circles with various petal numbers etc. Draw the circles (core region, convex hull sort-of).
Figure: Core ratio vs solidity ratio which is constant for de Broglie.

JM: To make sure maths works and write up just in case we care about it.

Figure: eRIDE (risk) vs solidity for de Broglie of various petal sizes.
