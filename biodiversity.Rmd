We compute total biodiversity $B = \cup_i B_i$ given total area $A = \sum_i A_i$ and power $z$ as follows.

$$
\begin{aligned}
B &= \bigcup_i B_i\\
  &= \bigcup_i A_i^z\\
  &= A^z \bigcup_i \frac{A_i^z}{A^z}\\
  &= A^z \left[1 - \bigcap_i \left( 1 - \frac{A_i^z}{A^z} \right)\right]\\
  &= A^z \left[1 - \prod_i \left( 1 - \frac{A_i^z}{A^z} \right)\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

Note: I used $z=0.3$ as the power in the simulation runs by the looks, but really we can substitute
any appropriate relationship in there I think?

The key is that on the outside of the union we have the biodiversity if there was no fragmentation,
then the union comprises the reduction in biodiversity as a consequence of fragmentation. This is derived
by assuming that the total biodiversity is randomly allocated (independently) to the smaller areas such
that the biodiversity in each small area is what it should be given the power law. Thus the ratios are
basically the proportion of biodiversity in each area, so that the intersections are just products
due to the independent sampling for each area.

## Formulae for balancing risk or biodiversity (or both) for differing numbers of fragments.

Suppose we are to divide an area into $m$ identical fragments with the same shape as the original.

Then the total biodiversity across the $m$ fragments will be
$$
\begin{aligned}
B &= A^z \left[1 - \prod_i \left( 1 - \frac{A_i^z}{A^z} \right)\right]\\
  &= A^z \left[1 - \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m^z} \right)^m\right]\\
\end{aligned}
$$
and hence the ratio of the total biodiversity of the $m$ fragments compared to the biodiversity
in the area is given by
$$
1 - \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m^z} \right)^m
$$

Using this, we can derive formulae for risk if biodiversity is balanced, and for biodiversity if risk
is balanced.

Assume that risk is balanced between the $m$ and 1 fragment cases. As risk is just biodiversity times the
perimeter, and as the perimeter is proportional to the square root of area, we see that
$$
\mathsf{Risk}(1, A) = k A^z A^{1/2} = k A ^ {z + 1/2}
$$
In the case where we have $m$ fragments, the total risk is just the sum of the individual risks, and hence
$$
\mathsf{Risk}(m, \hat{A}) = m \mathsf{Risk}(1, \frac{\hat{A}}{m}) = m k \left(\frac{\hat{A}}{m}\right)^{z + 1/2}
$$
If the risk in these cases are to be balanced, the total area in the $m$ fragment case, $\hat{A}$ may be found
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathsf{Risk}(m, \hat{A}) &= \mathsf{Risk}(1, A)\\
m k \left(\frac{\hat{A}}{m}\right)^{z + 1/2} &= k A ^ {z + 1/2}\\
\left(\frac{\hat{A}}{m}\right)^{z + 1/2} &= \frac{A ^ {z + 1/2}}{m}\\
\frac{\hat{A}}{m} &= \frac{A}{m^\frac{1}{z+1/2}}\\
\hat{A} &= A\frac{m}{m^\frac{1}{z+1/2}}\\
        &= A m^\frac{z-1/2}{z+1/2}
\end{aligned}
$$
Substituting this new total area, we find the biodiversity ratio in the case of $m$ fragments to be
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathsf{BR}(m) &= \frac{\hat{A}^z}{A^z}\left[1 - \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m^z} \right)^m\right]\\
&= m^{z\frac{z-1/2}{z+1/2}}\left[1 - \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m^z} \right)^m\right].
\end{aligned}
$$
In the same way, we can first balance biodiversity so that
$$
\begin{aligned}
B(m, \tilde{A}) &= B(1, A)\\
\tilde{A}^z\left[1 - \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m^z} \right)^m\right] &= A^z\\
\tilde{A}^z &= \frac{A^z}{\left[1 - \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m^z} \right)^m\right]}\\
\tilde{A} &= \frac{A}{\left[1 - \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m^z} \right)^m\right]^\frac{1}{z}}\\
\end{aligned}
$$
and hence the risk ratio in the case of $m$ fragments is
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathsf{RR}(m, \tilde{A}) &= \frac{m k \left(\frac{\tilde{A}}{m}\right)^{z + 1/2}}{k A ^ {z + 1/2}}\\
& = \frac{m k \left(\frac{A}{m\left[1 - \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m^z} \right)^m\right]^\frac{1}{z}}\right)^{z + 1/2}}{k A ^ {z + 1/2}}\\
& = \frac{m}{m^{z + 1/2}\left[1 - \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m^z} \right)^m\right]^\frac{z + 1/2}{z}}\\
& = \frac{1}{m^{z - 1/2}\left[1 - \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m^z} \right)^m\right]^\frac{z + 1/2}{z}}.\\
\end{aligned}
$$
TODO: Do we alter the above for differing powers in the risk computation? i.e. instead of using B, do we use $B^d$ instead?
